## WEEK 3: APIs, Authentication & Databases

### APIs & Authentication
**Description:**
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the building blocks of modern software, enabling different systems to communicate. Understanding API design and authentication methods is crucial for building secure and scalable applications.

- [What is an API? (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/)
- [APIs for Beginners (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByGJQzlzxQg)
- **Authentication:** Explore JWT Authentication, Token Based Authentication, Session Based Authentication

### Relational Databases (RDBMS)
**Description:**
Relational Database Management Systems are the foundation of data storage in modern applications. They organize data into tables with relationships, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

## WEEK 4: Microservices, Docker and Version Control

### Git & GitHub
**Description:**
Git is a distributed version control system that enables teams to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain code history. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration features.

### Microservices & Docker
**Description:**
Microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services, while Docker provides containerization for consistent deployment across environments. Together, they enable scalable and maintainable systems.
